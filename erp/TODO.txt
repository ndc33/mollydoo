[format]
page headings now have extra info and markup -> need to modify the templates to add the extra info instead


[interface]
template for creating sales orders /quotes from the order 
messaging ( along the lines of pinax notes or home made)
delivery process view
maps (route planning) view
fixed nabar with save button
possible add ui markdown format for notes etc
**forms are submitted automaticlly on pressing return** (which is good) 
also need keep scroll position (default is return to top)?



[DB/models]
multi select (e.g. m2m widget) for choices of note processes
race condition issue with tally
integers for choices 
need some way of marking certain records as protected
softdelete (no external packages)
model history (maybe reversion)
sort the address mess
put repeatedly called data into query annotations etc
possibly make work processes front end defineable
need to either change the tally to additive or lock db and check changes from displayed data on submit
need media files + interface (print etc)
order/product-process notes are a mess, perhaps make fixed/definable (like product types)
should create a filesystem copy of all principle documents as paper based backup 
more field indexes (e.g. active/deleted)
query directly on external objects when not changing often instead of prefetch etc


[logic]
need to make sure we can easily add arbitrary sales-order line-items


[external]
xero integration

[security and view limiting]
add group/role level permisions

[deployment]
postgres
ngix etc setup
multiple-workers
continous connection
workstations or tablets


[later]
optimisations
maybe more comprehensive search system
asset tracking model with calender and reminders
multi premisis
BOM with costing
inventory tracking
VPN access with limited roles
